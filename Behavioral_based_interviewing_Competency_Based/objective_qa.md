It was a long ago. I had the plan to move to NZ, 

I also began my plan, resigned from my job, and tried to move to New Zealand. But the pandemic came, I had to give up my plan.But recently, a few months ago, the immigration organization reacted to my work visa, so I resigned from my job immediately and began my plan. I’m very committed to relocating to New Zealand. So my long time plan is to make a life for my family and me here in New Zealand, and stick with our company.

Three years ago, I married and spent one month on our honeymoon in New Zealand. I love everything about New Zealand. Some things inspired me a lot.

Firstly, I’d like to talk about the **natural environment**. I had been to New Zealand three years ago, there were always blue sky and white clouds in sky and the river is very very clean. I had my honeymoon there and fell in love with this country. So I was determined to move to New Zealand three years ago.

And they were very kind to have dinner with us. They were **hospitable**, open, and friendly, and they had lunch or dinners with us.

Everyone on the street said hello to us if we met them. It was quite amazing experience.

If I asked where’s that place or where can I find that, they were very eager to help.They were always ready to help you. I felt welcomed in new Zealand.

I had this **immigration** plan for a long time, but the pandemic stopped my plan for about three years. My work visa recently became active again a few months ago, so I decided to continue my immigration plan. I resigned from my job to seek new opportunities in New Zealand.

~~Secondly, I want to take on more responsibilities in my next job opportunity.
e.g. I work as an iOS developer, but if the company requests me to perform any additional roles, I would happily agree. Because taking on more responsibilities will help me enhance my skills and experience.~~

//TODO: position **expectations**

## What type of work do you need? Contract work or permanent full-time job?

At this time, I am only considering **permanent full-time** employment, not contract work. However, if I change my mind, I will let you know again.

I used to use some programming languages like react-native and objective-c, swift. But, I still want to go further.

## What are your salary requirements?

## What are your salary and your expectations?

~~My first aspiration is to work in New Zealand. A secondary factor would be remuneration; perhaps my most recent salary would be a good guideline for you. Salary is not my predetermining condition; Working in New Zealand is.~~

~~A m**arket salary** would be great.~~

~~I want to share my last salary.~~ 

I am **particular** about my salary. I prepared for a **certain number** about the salary, say $XXX this is what I have in mind. 

(it's essential to say what you expect. Then the company will maybe come in with a lower offer. But then you can also say, I can't accept this one, but $xxx more. So you can negotiate, but go in with a number.)

## What is your hobby? What do you do to relax well?

I like exercising because I want to be a **balanced person**.

If I had time, I'd like to post blogs on the internet, share my experience with the public, conclude my knowledge, and try to share knowledge with the public.

## How are you going to settle since you're going to be with different nationalities?

What is the first thing you will do after working in New Zealand as a software engineer? How are you going to settle well?

Before I answer this question, I'd like to share my experience. I had been to New Zealand three years ago. When I married and had a honeymoon with my wife, this was my second time in New Zealand.

So, how can I adapt to life in New Zealand?

The most important thing is to continue my career in New Zealand and build strong relationships with the people I meet.

I have a lot of friends in New Zealand, and I also keep connected with them tightly, we share information about New Zealand, and I think it was pretty helpful, and I learned a lot of things about New Zealand. So I think maybe the country's culture and the company's culture and values influence me a lot, and I'd like to accept those things.

## Why do you want to do this job?

//TODO: STAR

Regarding the software engineer, I think this job is very frustrating and challenging. However, through this job, I can learn a lot of technical knowledge and try to solve some customers' problems. My job will provide much value to customers. I think it is worth it. Furthermore, in terms of my current job as a mobile phone developer, it's a kind of front development. I can provide some services directly to the customers. This way, I can influence customers and help them improve their lives and work. I think it is valuable.

I like your company because it's in the city I want to live in. I like the culture at your company and the good reviews about your company.

(For this question also try to mention something about the company and why do you want this job, you spoke about the technical aspects of your career but also try mention I like your company because it's in the city I want to live in or something specific to the company that's difficult to prep in advance. or something particular to the company.)

## If today were your first day of work, what would you do?

I want to do two kinds of things. 

Firstly I'd like to be familiar with the company's culture, like the company's values.

Secondly, introduce myself to team members, and socialize with them.

Thirdly, set up digital devices and prepare for my next task. First, I will learn about which technologies we are using and prepare for the knowledge a lot. And then, I'd like to review the project code to learn a lot about the business logic. In this way, I can start my next task quickly.
